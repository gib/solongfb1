# So Long, and Thanks for All the Pokes #1

Facebook has some amazing tech and is clearly a great platform. It just isn't for me.
Once I deleted my account I wanted to mark the occasion.

Inspired by [David Desandro](http://desandro.com), I created a Facebook mark out of HTML and CSS.
Specifically his [Curtis CSS Typeface](http://desandro.com/resources/curtis-css-typeface/) and 
[Opera logo with CSS](http://desandro.com/articles/opera-logo-css/) were great assets.
I'm a huge fan of his work.

## The Facebook Mark Markup

```html
  <span class='fb'>
    <span class='highlight-top'></span>
    <span class='highlight-bottom'></span>
    <span class='f'>
      <span class='arc'>
        <span class='arc-cap'></span>
      </span>
      <span class='cross'>
        <span class='cross-cap'></span>
      </span>
      <span class='bd'></span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span class='brand-shine'></span>
```

Check out the CSS in `css/solongfb.css` or using in your browser's inspect element option.

The JavaScript is not my best work, but hopefully read-able, see `js/solongfb.js`. The next experiment will have some modularity.

## The Content

I borrowed from Openbook.org to pull recent public Facebook posts using the open social graph API.
